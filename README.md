wallpyper

Python script to update your GNOME desktop background from an online source.


Usage

You can just run `python wallpyper.py` and you'll get one of this week's
top-upvoted images from [/r/wallpaper(s)](http://www.reddit.com/r/wallpaper+wallpapers/top/?sort=top&t=week).


Who are you? What have done?
----------------------------

My name is [Ben Jeffrey](http://benjeffrey.net). If you see any bugs or bad
form, perhaps fork me and send a pull request? I'd really appreciate it!

This has mostly been a project to brush up my Python skills (and familiarity
with libraries), so if you take a peek inside, you can see that `wallpyper`
(named no more tackily than any other Python program...) uses:

* command-line arguments
* API calls
* HTML scraping
* regular expressions
* external process calls
* oh my!

Next though, I want to add some tests, and make it look like something I could
install with `pip`. Hooray!
